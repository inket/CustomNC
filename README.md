## CustomNC

When Mountain Lion came out and I had to switch to Notification Centre from Growl (in an effort to reduce redundancy), I kind of missed the control I had over how notifications are displayed. Especially banners, which seemed to stay on screen for an unnecessary long time.

So I came up with this.

Essentially, it's an app to personalise your Notification Centre banners and alerts. It's risk-free, easy to setup and uninstalls with a single click.

What it does behind the scenes is:

- Install a SIMBL plugin and gives it your parameters
